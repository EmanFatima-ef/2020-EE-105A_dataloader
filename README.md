# MyDataLoader

MyDataLoader is a Python class designed to simplify the process of loading image data for machine learning tasks using PyTorch. It provides a convenient interface for loading image datasets, applying transformations, and creating data loaders for training or evaluation.

## Features

- Loads image data from a specified directory structure (have to change the path to the desired directory)
- Creates data loaders for loading data in batches.
- Supports shuffling and dropping incomplete batches.

## Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine.
